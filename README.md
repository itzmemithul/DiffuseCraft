**Problem Statement**
1. Visualizing and planning interior designs that align with personal style and space constraints is challenging without professional assistance.
2. Traditional methods for customizing room aesthetics are time-consuming, expensive, and require multiple iterations to achieve satisfactory results.
3. Lack of accessible, user-friendly tools for individuals to experiment with and visualize interior design ideas quickly and accurately.

**Solution Scenario**
1. Utilize a fine-tuned Stable Diffusion model trained on an IKEA dataset to generate realistic interior designs.
2. Allow users to create room visuals by either entering a text prompt or uploading an image of their space for refinement.
3. Enhance user experience by providing quick and accurate visualizations that align with personal tastes and design preferences.
4. Integrate a multi-modal approach to support both prompt-based and image-refinement capabilities, enabling greater customization and flexibility.
